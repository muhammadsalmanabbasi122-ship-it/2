/**
 * Hard tamper-resistance check that runs once at every cold start of
 * the app and the IME service. The single most important check is
 * signature pinning — if a thief decompiles the APK, edits branding,
 * and re-signs with their own keystore, the actual signing-cert SHA
 * won't match the [ObfConstants.EXPECTED_SIGNING_SHA256] baked in at
 * build time → [verifyOrDie] returns false → the app sits on the lock
 * screen forever and the IME shows a "locked" view instead of the
 * keyboard. Nothing crashes — that would just get GhostType flagged
 * as malware. It just refuses to function.
 *
 * In debug builds we skip the check entirely so dev iteration isn't
 * blocked. In release builds compiled WITHOUT a keystore (the obf
 * generator couldn't compute a real SHA) we also skip — those are
 * for owner-side internal testing only and shouldn't be distributed.
