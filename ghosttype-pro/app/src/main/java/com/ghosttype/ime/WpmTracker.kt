/**
 * v1.10 — Live typing-speed (WPM) tracker shown on the suggestion strip,
 * right next to the ≡ menu button.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   • Each productive keystroke (letter, digit, symbol, space, punctuation)
 *     records a timestamp into a rolling 10-second window.
 *   • Backspace is intentionally NOT recorded — corrections shouldn't
 *     inflate the speed reading and "delete spam" would otherwise look
 *     like 200+ WPM.
 *   • WPM = (chars in window / 5) / (window seconds / 60). Standard WPM
 *     definition uses a 5-character "word" (matches Gboard / TypingClub /
 *     monkeytype.com), so a 60-char-per-minute typist reads 12 WPM.
 *   • After [IDLE_MS] of silence the tracker reports 0 so the strip badge
 *     fades back to "—" instead of holding a stale number.
 *
 * The tracker is a singleton because it lives across keyboard show/hide
 * cycles — closing & reopening the IME shouldn't reset the speed of an
 * ongoing typing session in the same chat field.
